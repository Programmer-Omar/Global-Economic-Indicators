# End-to-End Data Pipeline: Global Economic Indicators

## Data Acquisition, Cleaning, SQL Upload, and Analysis with Python and MySQL

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline built to analyze global economic trends across more than 200 countries over a 15-year period (2010â€“2025). Using Python in Google Colab, I accessed a Kaggle dataset through the Kaggle API, performed thorough data cleaning (including handling missing values), and uploaded the processed data into a MySQL database. From there, I conducted structured queries to explore economic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, GDP, and more.
